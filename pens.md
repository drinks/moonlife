[pilot g2](http://www.wired.com/2010/10/pilot-g2-mont-blanc-ink-refill-cheap-amazing-pen/)

### @bjames:
sharpie pen is my favorite. or anything felt-tip. as they dry faster than gel or ball-point and donâ€™t smear.

### @heyitsolivia:
[I buy these pilot ballpoint pens, smooth, reliable and smear-free](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Precise-Stick-Rolling-35334/dp/B00006IEBI).
Hard to find in stores, but luckily amazon has them in stock

### @caitlin:
I really like paper mate inkjoy pens. There are different qualities of them, which I haven't really nailed down, but the ink is basically a standard ball point pen, not wet but very smooth.

### @arowla:
disagree that Pilot G2 not good for lefties! That and the Pilot Precise are my favorite pens. Basically anything not-ballpoint.
