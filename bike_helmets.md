My experience is that no helmet is as cheap as you want it to be.<br/>
And DON’T buy a used helmet.<br />
If you aren’t concerned about fashion and are gonna have to spend money anyway, I’d recommend ventilation as your priority.<br/>
If you plan on riding in the rain, buy one that has a tiny visor on it.<br/>
If you had the feeling of a strap around your neck, be picky about a softer material (there is variation)<br/>
I guess the only other thing that I considered when buying mine was using it as a way to be as visible as possible…e.g., I did not buy a black one. Mine is neon yellow.

Maybe check [theclymb.com](http://theclymb.com) or [sierratradingpost.com](http://www.sierratradingpost.com) for discounted/last year’s models?<br/>
